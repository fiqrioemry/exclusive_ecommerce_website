# Frontend E-commerce Website App

I made a fully responsive e-commerce website built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides a seamless and intuitive user experience with a clean, modern interface. This project is designed for those who want a starting point for creating their own online store or e-commerce platform.

## Features
- 
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Product Listings**: Dynamically displays products with images, prices, and descriptions.
- **Product Search**: Allows users to search for products by name or category.
- **Filter & Sorting**: Provides options to filter products by categories and sort by price, popularity, or rating.
- **Shopping Cart**: Enables users to add, view, and remove products from their cart.
- **Checkout Page**: Includes a summary of selected products, total price calculation, and a button to proceed to checkout.
- **Cookies and Restricted Pages: Implements user authentication and session management using cookies. Pages that require authentication are restricted, and users are redirected to the login page if they attempt to access these areas without being logged in. The system utilizes dummyjson API for user data and authentication simulation.
- **Pagination**: Handles product listing with pagination for better performance and user experience.
- **Reusable Components**: Built with modular and reusable React components for maintainability.

## API Integration

This project fetches product data from the [dummyjson API](https://dummyjson.com/), ensuring a dynamic and real-time data-driven experience. All product details, including categories, pricing, and images, are retrieved from this external source.
